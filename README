This is a release of MySQL Shell (part of MySQL Server), an interactive
JavaScript, Python and SQL console interface, supporting development and
administration for the MySQL Server. It provides built in scriptable APIs
that support the creation and management of MySQL InnoDB clusters,
as well as a modern fluent CRUD API for the MySQL Document Store.
Connections to MySQL server can use X Protocol or classic MySQL protocol.

The AdminAPI enables you to work with MySQL InnoDB cluster, providing
an integrated solution for high availability and scalability using
InnoDB based MySQL databases, without requiring advanced MySQL
expertise. For more information about how to configure and work with
MySQL InnoDB cluster see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/mysql-innodb-cluster-userguide.html.

The Document Store X DevAPI enables developers and DBAs to create "schema-less"
JSON document collections and perform Create, Update, Read, Delete (CRUD)
operations on those collections without in depth knowledge of the SQL language.

Additionally, MySQL Shell (part of MySQL Server) provides partial compatibility
with the mysql command line client by supporting many of the same command line
options. As with the mysql command line, MySQL Shell (part of MySQL Server) can
also be used to connect to and send SQL commands to MySQL server using the
classic MySQL protocol.
