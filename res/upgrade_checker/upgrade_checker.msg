Usage of old temporal type

MySQL syntax check for routine-like objects

* syntax.description
The following objects did not pass a syntax check with the latest MySQL grammar. A common reason
is that they reference names that conflict with new reserved keywords. You must update these
routine definitions and `quote` any such references before upgrading.\n
These checks were performed using the MySQL %selected_version% syntax.

* syntax.warning
WARNING: SQL syntax checks were performed for a version newer than the target %target_version%.
Some syntax errors may not apply to the actual target version, but it is recommended that they
be fixed anyway to make future upgrades easier. You may skip this check by using the {"exclude":["syntax"]} option.

handler, and the MySQL server no longer provides generic partitioning support. InnoDB and NDB are
the only storage engines that provide a native partitioning handler that is supported in the

Warning: By default zero date/datetime/timestamp values are no longer allowed in MySQL, as of
5.7.8 NO_ZERO_IN_DATE and NO_ZERO_DATE are included in SQL_MODE by default. These modes should be
used with strict mode as they will be merged with strict mode in a future release. If you do not
include these modes in your SQL_MODE setting, you are able to insert date/datetime/timestamp

* ftsInTablename.title
Table names containing 'FTS'

* ftsInTablename.description
Error: Upgrading from 5.7 to the latest MySQL version does not support tables with name
containing 'FTS' character string. The workaround is to rename the table for the upgrade - e.g.
it is enough to change any letter of the 'FTS' part to a lower case. It can be renamed back again
after the upgrade.

* engineMixup.title
Tables recognized by InnoDB that belong to a different engine

* engineMixup.description
Error: Following tables are recognized by InnoDB engine while the SQL layer believes they belong to
a different engine. Such situation may happen when one removes InnoDB table files manually from the
disk and creates e.g. a MyISAM table with the same name.\n
\n
A possible way to solve this situation is to e.g. in case of MyISAM table:\n
\n
1. Rename the MyISAM table to a temporary name (RENAME TABLE).\n
2. Create some dummy InnoDB table (its definition does not need to match), then copy (copy, not
move) and rename the dummy .frm and .ibd files to the orphan name using OS file commands.\n
3. The orphan table can be then dropped (DROP TABLE), as well as the dummy table.\n
4. Finally the MyISAM table can be renamed back to its original name.

Spatial data columns created in MySQL 5.6

* oldGeometryTypes.description
Error: The following columns are spatial data columns created in MySQL Server version 5.6. MySQL
8.0 servers before 8.0.24 do not support upgrading these tables and will reject them. In order for
the upgrade to succeed we encourage you to upgrade directly to MySQL Server version 8.0.24 or
newer. Otherwise, you must rebuild these tables using ALTER TABLE FORCE before upgrading.

* defaultAuthenticationPlugin.title
New default authentication plugin considerations

* defaultAuthenticationPlugin.description
Warning: The default authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password' offers more secure password
hashing than previously used 'mysql_native_password' (and consequent improved client connection
authentication). However, it also has compatibility implications that may affect existing MySQL
installations.  If your MySQL installation must serve pre-8.0 clients and you encounter
compatibility issues after upgrading, the simplest way to address those issues is to reconfigure
the server to revert to the previous default authentication plugin (mysql_native_password). For
example, use these lines in the server option file:\n
\n
[mysqld]\n
default_authentication_plugin=mysql_native_password\n
\n
However, the setting should be viewed as temporary, not as a long term or permanent solution,
because it causes new accounts created with the setting in effect to forego the improved
authentication security.\n
\n
MySQL 8.4.0 removes the deprecated default_authentication_plugin option.\n
The deprecated mysql_native_password authentication plugin is disabled by default as of 
MySQL 8.4.0, and is subject to removal in a future version.\n

If you are using replication please take time to understand how the authentication plugin changes
may impact you.
