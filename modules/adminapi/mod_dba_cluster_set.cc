Creates a new InnoDB Cluster that is a Replica of the Primary Cluster.

@param instance host:port of the target instance to be used to create the
Replica Cluster
@param clusterName An identifier for the REPLICA cluster to be created.
@param options optional Dictionary with additional parameters described below.

@returns The created Replica Cluster object.

Creates a REPLICA InnoDB cluster of the current PRIMARY cluster with the given
cluster name and options, at the target instance.

If the target instance meets the requirements for InnoDB Cluster a new cluster
is created on it, replicating from the PRIMARY instance of the primary cluster
of the ClusterSet.

<b>Pre-requisites</b>

The following is a list of requirements to create a REPLICA cluster:

@li The target instance must comply with the requirements for InnoDB Cluster.
@li The target instance must be a standalone instance.
@li The target instance must running MySQL 8.0.27 or newer.
@li Unmanaged replication channels are not allowed.
@li The target instance 'server_id' and 'server_uuid' must be unique in the
ClusterSet
@li The target instance must have the same credentials used to manage the
ClusterSet.

The Replica Cluster's name must be non-empty and no greater than 63 characters
long. It can only start with an alphanumeric character or with _ (underscore),
and can only contain alphanumeric, _ ( underscore), . (period), or - ( hyphen)
characters.

For the detailed list of requirements to create an InnoDB Cluster, please use
\? createCluster

<b>Options</b>

The options dictionary can contain the following values:

${OPT_INTERACTIVE}
@li dryRun: boolean if true, all validations and steps for creating a
Replica Cluster are executed, but no changes are actually made. An
exception will be thrown when finished.
@li recoveryMethod: Preferred method for state recovery/provisioning. May be
auto, clone or incremental. Default is auto.
@li recoveryProgress: Integer value to indicate the recovery process verbosity
level.
@li cloneDonor: host:port of an existing member of the PRIMARY cluster to
clone from. IPv6 addresses are not supported for this option.
@li manualStartOnBoot: boolean (default false). If false, Group Replication in
cluster instances will automatically start and rejoin when MySQL starts,
otherwise it must be started manually.

${CLUSTER_OPT_EXIT_STATE_ACTION}
${CLUSTER_OPT_MEMBER_WEIGHT}
${CLUSTER_OPT_CONSISTENCY}
${CLUSTER_OPT_EXPEL_TIMEOUT}
${CLUSTER_OPT_AUTO_REJOIN_TRIES}
@li timeout: maximum number of seconds to wait for the instance to sync up
with the PRIMARY Cluster. Default is 0 and it means no timeout.
@li replicationAllowedHost: string value to use as the host name part of
internal replication accounts (i.e. 'mysql_innodb_cluster_###'@'hostname').
Default is %. It must be possible for any member of the Cluster to connect to
any other member using accounts with this hostname value.

${CLUSTER_OPT_REPLICATION_OPTION_ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL}
${CLUSTER_OPT_REPLICATION_OPTION_BIND}
${CLUSTER_OPT_REPLICATION_OPTION_NETWORK_NAMESPACE}

The recoveryMethod option supports the following values:

@li incremental: waits until the new instance has applied missing transactions
from the PRIMARY
@li clone: uses MySQL clone to provision the instance, which completely
replaces the state of the target instance with a full snapshot of another
ClusterSet member.
@li auto: compares the transaction set of the instance with that of the
PRIMARY to determine if incremental recovery is safe to be automatically
chosen as the most appropriate recovery method.
A prompt will be shown if not possible to safely determine a safe way forward.
If interaction is disabled, the operation will be canceled instead.

If recoveryMethod is not specified 'auto' will be used by default.

The recoveryProgress option supports the following values:

@li 0: do not show any progress information.
@li 1: show detailed static progress information.
@li 2: show detailed dynamic progress information using progress bars.

By default, if the standard output on which the Shell is running refers to a
terminal, the recoveryProgress option has the value of 2. Otherwise, it has the
value of 1.

The cloneDonor option is used to override the automatic selection of a donor to
be used when clone is selected as the recovery method. By default, a SECONDARY
member will be chosen as donor. If no SECONDARY members are available the
PRIMARY will be selected. The option accepts values in the format: 'host:port'.
IPv6 addresses are not supported.

${CLUSTER_OPT_MEMBER_SSL_MODE_DETAIL}

${CLUSTER_OPT_IP_ALLOWLIST_EXTRA}

The groupName and localAddress are advanced options and their usage is
discouraged since incorrect values can lead to Group Replication errors.

The value for groupName is used to set the Group Replication system variable
'group_replication_group_name'.

${CLUSTER_OPT_LOCAL_ADDRESS_EXTRA}

Removes a MySQL InnoDB Replica Cluster from the target ClusterSet.

The Cluster is removed from the ClusterSet and implicitly dissolved, i.e. each
member of it becomes a standalone instance.

For the Cluster to be successfully removed from the ClusterSet the PRIMARY
Cluster must be available and the ClusterSet replication channel healthy. If
those conditions aren't met the Cluster can still be forcefully removed
using the 'force' option, however, its Metadata won't be updated
compromising the effortless usage of its members to create new Clusters
and/or add to existing Clusters. To re-use those instances, the Metadata
schema must be dropped using dba.<<<dropMetadataSchema>>>(), or the Cluster
rebooted from complete outage using
dba.<<<rebootClusterFromCompleteOutage>>>().

<b>Options</b>

@li force: boolean, indicating if the cluster must be removed (even if
           only from metadata) in case the PRIMARY cannot be reached, or
           the ClusterSet replication channel cannot be found or is stopped.

Performs a safe switchover of the PRIMARY Cluster of the ClusterSet.

@param options optional Dictionary with additional parameters described below.

@returns Nothing

This command will perform a safe switchover of the PRIMARY Cluster
of a ClusterSet. The current PRIMARY will be demoted to a REPLICA
Cluster, while the promoted Cluster will be made the PRIMARY Cluster.
All other REPLICA Clusters will be updated to replicate from the new
PRIMARY.

During the switchover, the promoted Cluster will be synchronized with
the old PRIMARY, ensuring that all transactions present in the PRIMARY
are applied before the topology change is committed. The current PRIMARY
instance is also locked with 'FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK' in order to prevent
changes during the switch. If either of these operations take too long or fails,
the switch will be aborted.

For a switchover to be possible, all instances of the target
Cluster must be reachable from the shell and have consistent transaction
sets with the current PRIMARY Cluster. If the PRIMARY Cluster is not
available and cannot be restored, a failover must be performed instead, using
ClusterSet.<<<forcePrimaryCluster>>>().

The switchover will be canceled if there are REPLICA Clusters that
are unreachable or unavailable. To continue, they must either be restored or
invalidated by including their name in the 'invalidateReplicaClusters' option.
Invalidated REPLICA Clusters must be either removed from the Cluster or restored
and rejoined, using <<<removeCluster>>>() or <<<rejoinCluster>>>().

Additionally, if any available REPLICA Cluster has members that are not ONLINE
and/or reachable, these members will not be in a properly configured state even
after being restored and rejoined. To ensure failover works correctly,
<<<rejoinCluster>>>() must be called on the Cluster once these members are
rejoined.

<b>Options</b>

@li dryRun: if true, will perform checks and log operations that would be
performed, but will not execute them. The operations that would be
performed can be viewed by enabling verbose output in the shell.
@li timeout: integer value to set the maximum number of seconds to wait
for the synchronization of the Cluster and also for the instance
being promoted to catch up with the current PRIMARY (in the case of the latter,
the default value is retrieved from the 'dba.gtidWaitTimeout' shell option).

Performs a failover of the PRIMARY Cluster of the ClusterSet.

@param clusterName Name of the REPLICA cluster to be promoted.
@param options optional Dictionary with additional parameters described below.

@returns Nothing

This command will perform a failover of the PRIMARY Cluster
of a ClusterSet. The target cluster is promoted to the new PRIMARY Cluster
while the previous PRIMARY Cluster is invalidated. The previous PRIMARY Cluster
is presumed unavailable by the Shell, but if that is not the case, it is
recommended that instances of that Cluster are taken down to avoid or minimize
inconsistencies.

The failover will be canceled if there are REPLICA Clusters that
are unreachable or unavailable. To continue, they must either be restored or
invalidated by including their name in the 'invalidateReplicaClusters' option.

Additionally, if any available REPLICA Cluster has members that are not ONLINE
and/or reachable, these members will not be in a properly configured state even
after being restored and rejoined. To ensure failover works correctly,
<<<rejoinCluster>>>() must be called on the Cluster once these members are
rejoined.

Note that because a failover may result in loss of transactions, it is always
preferrable that the PRIMARY Cluster is restored.

<b>Aftermath of a Failover</b>

If a failover is the only viable option to recover from an outage, the following
must be considered:

@li The topology of the ClusterSet, including a record of "who is the primary",
is stored in the ClusterSet itself. In a failover, the metadata is updated to
reflect the new topology and the invalidation of the old primary.
However, if the invalidated primary is still ONLINE somewhere, the copy of the
metadata held there will will remain outdated and inconsistent with the actual
topology. MySQL Router instances that can connect to the new PRIMARY Cluster
will be able to tell which topology is the correct one, but those instances
that can only connect to the invalid Cluster will behave as if nothing changed.
If applications can still update the database through such Router instances,
there will be a "Split-Brain" and the database will become inconsistent. To
avoid such scenario, fence the old primary from all traffic using
Cluster.<<<fenceAllTraffic>>>(), or from write traffic only using
Cluster.<<<fenceWrites>>>().

@li An invalidated PRIMARY Cluster that is later restored can only be rejoined
if its GTID set has not diverged relative to the rest of the ClusterSet.

@li A diverged invalidated Cluster can only be removed from the ClusterSet.
Recovery and reconciliation of transactions that only exist in that Cluster
can only be done manually.

@li Because regular Asynchronous Replication is used between PRIMARY and
REPLICA Clusters, any transactions at the PRIMARY that were not yet replicated
at the time of the failover will be lost. Even if the original PRIMARY Cluster
is restored at some point, these transactions would have to be recovered
and reconciled manually.

Thus, the recommended course of action in event of an outage is to always
restore the PRIMARY Cluster if at all possible, even if a failover may be faster
and easier in the short term.

<b>Options</b>

The following options may be given:

@li dryRun: if true, will perform checks and log operations that would be
performed, but will not execute them. The operations that would be
performed can be viewed by enabling verbose output in the shell.
@li invalidateReplicaClusters: list of names of REPLICA Clusters that are
unreachable or unavailable that are to be invalidated during the failover.
@li timeout: integer value with the maximum number of seconds to wait for
pending transactions to be applied in each instance of the cluster (default
value is retrieved from the 'dba.gtidWaitTimeout' shell option).

Changes the value of either a global Routing option or of a single Router
instance.

@param router optional identifier of the target router instance (e.g.
192.168.45.70@::system).
@param option The Router option to be changed.
@param value The value that the option shall get (or null to unset).

@returns Nothing.

The accepted options are:

@li target_cluster: Target Cluster for Router routing operations. Default value
is 'primary'.
@li invalidated_cluster_policy: Routing policy to be taken when the target
cluster is detected as being invalidated. Default value is 'drop_all'.
@li stats_updates_frequency: Number of seconds between updates that the Router
is to make to its statistics in the InnoDB Cluster metadata.
@li use_replica_primary_as_rw: Enable/Disable the RW Port in Replica Clusters.
Disabled by default.
@li tags: Associates an arbitrary JSON object with custom key/value pairs with
the ClusterSet metadata.
@li read_only_targets: Routing policy to define Router's usage of Read
Replicas. Default is 'append'.

The target_cluster option supports the following values:

@li primary: Follow the Primary Cluster whenever it changes in runtime (
default).
@li @<clusterName@>: Use the Cluster named @<clusterName@> as target.

The invalidated_cluster_policy option supports the following values:

@li accept_ro: all the RW connections are be dropped and no new RW connections
are be accepted. RO connections keep being accepted and handled.
@li drop_all: all connections to the target Cluster are closed and no new
connections will be accepted (default).

The stats_updates_frequency option accepts positive integers and sets the
frequency of updates of Router stats (timestamp, version, etc.), in seconds,
in the Metadata. If set to 0 (default), no periodic updates are done. Router
will round up the value to be a multiple of Router's TTL, i.e.:

@li If lower than TTL its gets rounded up to TTL, e.g. TTL=30, and
stats_updates_frequency=1, effective frequency is 30 seconds.

@li If not a multiple of TTL it will be rounded up and adjusted according to
the TTL, e.g. TTL=5, stats_updates_frequency=11, effective frequency is 15
seconds; TTL=5, stats_updates_frequency=13, effective frequency is 15 seconds.

If the value is null, the option value is cleared and the default value (0)
takes effect.

The use_replica_primary_as_rw option accepts a boolean value to configure
whether the Router should enable or disable the RW Port for the target Cluster.

When enabled, forces the RW port of Routers targeting a specific Cluster
(target_cluster != 'primary') to always route to the PRIMARY of that Cluster,
even when it is in a REPLICA cluster and thus, read-only. By default, the
option is false and Router blocks connections to the RW port in this
scenario.

The read_only_targets option supports the following values:

@li all: All Read Replicas of the target Cluster should be used along the
other SECONDARY Cluster members for R/O traffic.
@li read_replicas: Only Read Replicas of the target Cluster should be used for
R/O traffic.
@li secondaries: Only Secondary members of the target Cluster should be used
for R/O traffic (default).
