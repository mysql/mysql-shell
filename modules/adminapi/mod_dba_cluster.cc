@li recoveryMethod: Preferred method of state recovery. May be auto, clone or
incremental. Default is auto.
@li waitRecovery: Integer value to indicate if the command shall wait for the
recovery process to finish and its verbosity level. Deprecated.

The label must be non-empty and no greater than 256 characters long. It must be
unique within the Cluster and can only contain alphanumeric, _ (underscore),
. (period), - (hyphen), or : (colon) characters.

The password may be contained on the instance definition, however, it can be
overwritten if it is specified on the options.

The recoveryMethod option supports the following values:

@li incremental: uses distributed state recovery, which applies missing
transactions copied from another cluster member. Clone will be disabled.
@li clone: clone: uses built-in MySQL clone support, which completely replaces
the state of the target instance with a full snapshot of another cluster member
before distributed recovery starts. Requires MySQL 8.0.17 or newer.
@li auto: let Group Replication choose whether or not a full snapshot has to be
taken, based on what the target server supports and the
group_replication_clone_threshold sysvar.
This is the default value. A prompt will be shown if not possible to safely
determine a safe way forward. If interaction is disabled, the operation will be
canceled instead.

The waitRecovery option supports the following values:

@li 0: do not wait and let the recovery process to finish in the background.
@li 1: block until the recovery process to finishes.
@li 2: block until the recovery process finishes and show progress information.
@li 3: block until the recovery process finishes and show progress using
progress bars.

The recoveryProgress option supports the following values:

@li 0: do not show any progress information.
@li 1: show detailed static progress information.
@li 2: show detailed dynamic progress information using progress bars.

By default, if the standard output on which the Shell is running refers to a
terminal, the waitRecovery option has the value of 3. Otherwise, it has the
value of 2.

This function rescans the cluster for new and obsolete Group Replication

single-primary and multi-primary).

The options dictionary may contain the following attributes:

@li addInstances: List with the connection data of the new active instances to
add to the metadata, or "auto" to automatically add missing instances to the
metadata. Deprecated.

@li removeInstances: List with the connection data of the obsolete instances to
remove from the metadata, or "auto" to automatically remove obsolete instances
from the metadata. Deprecated.
@li updateTopologyMode: boolean value used to indicate if the topology mode
(single-primary or multi-primary) in the metadata should be updated (true) or
not (false) to match the one being used by the cluster. By default, the
metadata is not updated (false). Deprecated.
@li upgradeCommProtocol: boolean. Set to true to upgrade the Group Replication
communication protocol to the highest version possible.
@li updateViewChangeUuid: boolean value used to indicate if the command should
generate and set a value for Group Replication View Change UUID in the whole
Cluster. Required for InnoDB ClusterSet usage (if running MySQL version lower
than 8.3.0).
@li addUnmanaged: set to true to automatically add newly discovered instances,
i.e. already part of the replication topology but not managed in the Cluster,
to the metadata. Defaults to false.
@li removeObsolete: set to true to automatically remove all obsolete instances,
i.e. no longer part of the replication topology, from the metadata. Defaults
to false.

The value for addInstances and removeInstances is used to specify which
instances to add or remove from the metadata, respectively. Both options accept
list connection data. In addition, the "auto" value can be used for both
options in order to automatically add or remove the instances in the metadata,
without having to explicitly specify them.

@attention The updateTopologyMode option will be removed in a future release.

@attention The interactive option will be removed in a future release.

The replicationSources is a comma separated list of instances (host:port) to
act as sources of the replication channel, i.e. to provide source failover of
the channel. The first member of the list is configured with the highest
priority among all members so when the channel activates it will be chosen for
the first connection attempt. By default, the source list is automatically
managed by Group Replication according to the current group membership and the
primary member of the Cluster is the current source for the replication
channel, this is the same as setting to "primary". Alternatively, it's
possible to set to "secondary" to instruct Group Replication to automatically
manage the list but use a secondary member of the Cluster as source.

@param option The Router option to be changed.
@param value The value that the option shall get (or null to unset).

@returns Nothing.

The accepted options are:

@li tags: Associates an arbitrary JSON object with custom key/value pairs with
the Cluster metadata.
@li read_only_targets: Routing policy to define Router's usage of Read Only
instance. Default is 'secondaries'.
@li stats_updates_frequency: Number of seconds between updates that the Router
is to make to its statistics in the InnoDB Cluster metadata.
@li unreachable_quorum_allowed_traffic: Routing policy to define Router's behavior
regarding traffic destinations (ports) when it loses access to the Cluster's quorum.

The read_only_targets option supports the following values:

@li all: All Read Replicas of the target Cluster should be used along the
other SECONDARY Cluster members for R/O traffic.
@li read_replicas: Only Read Replicas of the target Cluster should be used for
R/O traffic.
@li secondaries: Only Secondary members of the target Cluster should be used
for R/O traffic (default).

The stats_updates_frequency option accepts positive integers and sets the
frequency of updates of Router stats (timestamp, version, etc.), in seconds,
in the Metadata. If set to 0 (default), no periodic updates are done. Router
will round up the value to be a multiple of Router's TTL, i.e.:

@li If lower than TTL its gets rounded up to TTL, e.g. TTL=30, and
stats_updates_frequency=1, effective frequency is 30 seconds.

@li If not a multiple of TTL it will be rounded up and adjusted according to
the TTL, e.g. TTL=5, stats_updates_frequency=11, effective frequency is 15
seconds; TTL=5, stats_updates_frequency=13, effective frequency is 15 seconds.

If the value is null, the option value is cleared and the default value (0)
takes effect.

The unreachable_quorum_allowed_traffic option allows configuring Router's behavior
in the event of a loss of quorum on the only reachable Cluster partition. By
default, Router will disconnect all existing connections and refuse new ones,
but that can be configured using the following options:

@li read: Router will keep using ONLINE members as Read-Only destination, leaving
the RO and RW-split ports open.
@li all: Router will keep ONLINE members as Read/Write destinations, leaving all
ports (RW, RO, and RW-split), open.
@li none: All current connections are disconnected and new ones are refused (default behavior).

@attention Setting this option to a different value other than the default may have unwanted
consequences: the consistency guarantees provided by InnoDB Cluster are broken
since the data read can be stale; different Routers may be accessing different
partitions, thus return different data; and different Routers may also have different
behavior (i.e. some provide only read traffic while others read and write traffic). Note that
writes on a partition with no quorum will block until quorum is restored.

This option has no practical effect if group_replication_unreachable_majority_timeout
is set to a positive value and group_replication_exit_state_action is either
OFFLINE_MODE or ABORT_SERVER.

REGISTER_HELP_FUNCTION(createClusterSet, Cluster);
REGISTER_HELP_FUNCTION_TEXT(CLUSTER_CREATECLUSTERSET, R"*(
Creates a MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet from an existing standalone InnoDB Cluster.

@param domainName An identifier for the ClusterSet's logical dataset.
@param options Optional dictionary with additional parameters described below.

@returns The created ClusterSet object.

Creates a ClusterSet object from an existing cluster, with the given data
domain name.

Several checks and validations are performed to ensure that the target Cluster
complies with the requirements for ClusterSets and if so, the Metadata schema
will be updated to create the new ClusterSet and the target Cluster becomes
the PRIMARY cluster of the ClusterSet.

<b>InnoDB ClusterSet</b>

A ClusterSet is composed of a single PRIMARY InnoDB Cluster that can have one
or more replica InnoDB Clusters that replicate from the PRIMARY using
asynchronous replication.

ClusterSets allow InnoDB Cluster deployments to achieve fault-tolerance at
a whole Data Center / region or geographic location, by creating REPLICA clusters
in different locations (Data Centers), ensuring Disaster Recovery is possible.

If the PRIMARY InnoDB Cluster becomes completely unavailable, it's possible to
promote a REPLICA of that cluster to take over its duties with minimal downtime
or data loss.

All Cluster operations are available at each individual member (cluster) of the
ClusterSet. The AdminAPI ensures all updates are performed at the PRIMARY and
controls the command availability depending on the individual status of each
Cluster.

Please note that InnoDB ClusterSets don't have the same consistency and data
loss guarantees as InnoDB Clusters. To read more about ClusterSets, see \?
ClusterSet or refer to the MySQL manual.

<b>Pre-requisites</b>

The following is a non-exhaustive list of requirements to create a ClusterSet:

@li The target cluster must not already be part of a ClusterSet.
@li MySQL 8.0.27 or newer.
@li The target cluster's Metadata schema version is 2.1.0 or newer.
@li Unmanaged replication channels are not allowed.

The domainName must be non-empty and no greater than 63 characters long. It can
only start with an alphanumeric character or with _ (underscore), and can only
contain alphanumeric, _ ( underscore), . (period), or - (hyphen) characters.

<b>Options</b>

The options dictionary can contain the following values:

@li dryRun: boolean if true, all validations and steps for creating a
ClusterSet are executed, but no changes are actually made. An
exception will be thrown when finished.
@li clusterSetReplicationSslMode: SSL mode for the ClusterSet replication channels.
@li replicationAllowedHost: string value to use as the host name part of
internal replication accounts (i.e. 'mysql_innodb_cs_###'@'hostname').
Default is %. It must be possible for any member of the ClusterSet to connect to
any other member using accounts with this hostname value.

The clusterSetReplicationSslMode option supports the following values:

@li DISABLED: TLS encryption is disabled for the ClusterSet replication channels.
@li REQUIRED: TLS encryption is enabled for the ClusterSet replication channels.
@li VERIFY_CA: like REQUIRED, but additionally verify the peer server TLS certificate against the configured Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.
@li VERIFY_IDENTITY: like VERIFY_CA, but additionally verify that the peer server certificate matches the host to which the connection is attempted.
@li AUTO: TLS encryption will be enabled if supported by the instance, otherwise disabled.

If clusterSetReplicationSslMode is not specified, it defaults to the value of the cluster's memberSslMode option.

Adds a Read Replica Instance to the Cluster.

@param instance host:port of the target instance to be added as a Read Replica.
@param options optional Dictionary with additional parameters described below.

@returns nothing

This function adds an Instance acting as Read-Replica of an InnoDB Cluster.

<b>Pre-requisites</b>

The following is a list of requirements to create a REPLICA cluster:

@li The target instance must be a standalone instance.
@li The target instance and Cluster must running MySQL 8.0.23 or newer.
@li Unmanaged replication channels are not allowed.
@li The target instance server_id and server_uuid must be unique in the
topology, including among OFFLINE or unreachable members

<b>Options</b>

The options dictionary may contain the following values:

@li dryRun: boolean if true, all validations and steps for creating a
Read Replica Instance are executed, but no changes are actually made. An
exception will be thrown when finished.
@li label: an identifier for the Read Replica Instance being added, used in
the output of status() and describe().
@li replicationSources: The list of sources for the Read Replica Instance. By
default, the list is automatically managed by Group Replication and the
primary member is used as source.
@li recoveryMethod: Preferred method for state recovery/provisioning. May be
auto, clone or incremental. Default is auto.
@li recoveryProgress: Integer value to indicate the recovery process verbosity
level.
@li timeout: maximum number of seconds to wait for the instance to sync up
with the PRIMARY after it's provisioned and the replication channel is
established. If reached, the operation is rolled-back. Default is 0 (no
timeout).
${CLUSTER_OPT_CLONE_DONOR}

The label must be non-empty and no greater than 256 characters long. It must be
unique within the Cluster and can only contain alphanumeric, _ (underscore),
. (period), - (hyphen), or : (colon) characters.

The replicationSources is a comma separated list of instances (host:port) to
act as sources of the replication channel, i.e. to provide source failover of
the channel. The first member of the list is configured with the highest
priority among all members so when the channel activates it will be chosen for
the first connection attempt. By default, the source list is automatically
managed by Group Replication according to the current group membership and the
primary member of the Cluster is the current source for the replication
channel, this is the same as setting to "primary". Alternatively, it's
possible to set to "secondary" to instruct Group Replication to automatically
manage the list too but use a secondary member of the Cluster as source.

The recoveryMethod option supports the following values:

@li incremental: waits until the new instance has applied missing transactions
from the source.
@li clone: uses MySQL clone to provision the instance, which completely
replaces the state of the target instance with a full snapshot of the
instance's source.
@li auto: compares the transaction set of the instance with that of the
source to determine if incremental recovery is safe to be automatically
chosen as the most appropriate recovery method.
A prompt will be shown if not possible to safely determine a safe way forward.
If interaction is disabled, the operation will be canceled instead.

If recoveryMethod is not specified 'auto' will be used by default.

The recoveryProgress option supports the following values:

@li 0: do not show any progress information.
@li 1: show detailed static progress information.
@li 2: show detailed dynamic progress information using progress bars.

By default, if the standard output on which the Shell is running refers to a
terminal, the recoveryProgress option has the value of 2. Otherwise, it has the
value of 1.
