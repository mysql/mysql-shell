Adds an instance to the replicaset.

@param instance host:port of the target instance to be added.
@param options Optional dictionary with options for the operation.

@returns Nothing.

This function adds the given MySQL instance as a read-only SECONDARY replica of
the current PRIMARY of the replicaset. Replication will be configured between
the added instance and the PRIMARY. Replication will use an automatically
created MySQL account with a random password.

Once the instance is added to the replicaset, the function will wait for it to
apply all pending transactions. The transaction sync may timeout if the
transaction backlog is large. The timeout option may be used to increase that
time.

The Shell connects to the target instance using the same username and
password used to obtain the replicaset handle object. All instances of the
replicaset are expected to have this same admin account with the same grants
and passwords. A custom admin account with the required grants can be created
while an instance is configured with dba.<<<configureReplicaSetInstance>>>(),
but the root user may be used too.

The PRIMARY of the replicaset must be reachable and available during this
operation.

<b>Pre-Requisites</b>

The following pre-requisites are expected for instances added to a replicaset.
They will be automatically checked by <<<addInstance>>>(), which will stop
if any issues are found.

@li binary log and replication related options must have been validated
and/or configured by dba.<<<configureReplicaSetInstance>>>()

If the selected recovery method is incremental:

@li transaction set in the instance being added must not contain transactions
that don't exist in the PRIMARY
@li transaction set in the instance being added must not be missing transactions
that have been purged from the binary log of the PRIMARY

If clone is available, the pre-requisites listed above can be overcome by using
clone as the recovery method.

<b>Options</b>

The options dictionary may contain the following values:

@li dryRun: if true, performs checks and logs changes that would be made, but
does not execute them
@li label: an identifier for the instance being added, used in the output of
status()
@li recoveryMethod: Preferred method of state recovery. May be auto, clone or
incremental. Default is auto.
@li waitRecovery: Integer value to indicate the recovery process verbosity
level.
@li recoveryProgress: Integer value to indicate the recovery process verbosity
level.
@li cloneDonor: host:port of an existing replicaSet member to clone from.
IPv6 addresses are not supported for this option.
${OPT_INTERACTIVE}
@li timeout: timeout in seconds for transaction sync operations; 0 disables
timeout and force the Shell to wait until the transaction sync finishes.
Defaults to 0.
${OPT_CERT_SUBJECT}
@li replicationConnectRetry: integer that specifies the interval in seconds
between the reconnection attempts that the replica makes after the connection
to the source times out.
@li replicationRetryCount: integer that sets the maximum number of reconnection
attempts that the replica makes after the connection to the source times out.
@li replicationHeartbeatPeriod: decimal that controls the heartbeat interval,
which stops the connection timeout occurring in the absence of data if the
connection is still good.
@li replicationCompressionAlgorithms: string that specifies the permitted
compression algorithms for connections to the replication source.
@li replicationZstdCompressionLevel: integer that specifies the compression
level to use for connections to the replication source server that use the
zstd compression algorithm.
@li replicationBind: string that determines which of the replica's network
interfaces is chosen for connecting to the source.
@li replicationNetworkNamespace: string that specifies the network namespace
to use for TCP/IP connections to the replication source server.

The recoveryMethod option supports the following values:

@li incremental: waits until the new instance has applied missing transactions
from the PRIMARY
@li clone: uses MySQL clone to provision the instance, which completely
replaces the state of the target instance with a full snapshot of another
ReplicaSet member. Requires MySQL 8.0.17 or newer.
@li auto: compares the transaction set of the instance with that of the
PRIMARY to determine if incremental recovery is safe to be automatically
chosen as the most appropriate recovery method.
A prompt will be shown if not possible to safely determine a safe way forward.
If interaction is disabled, the operation will be canceled instead.

If recoveryMethod is not specified 'auto' will be used by default.

The waitRecovery option supports the following values:

@li 0: not supported.
@li 1: do not show any progress information.
@li 2: show detailed static progress information.
@li 3: show detailed dynamic progress information using progress bars.

The recoveryProgress option supports the following values:

@li 0: do not show any progress information.
@li 1: show detailed static progress information.
@li 2: show detailed dynamic progress information using progress bars.

By default, if the standard output on which the Shell is running refers to a
terminal, the waitRecovery option has the value of 3. Otherwise, it has the
value of 2.

The cloneDonor option is used to override the automatic selection of a donor to
be used when clone is selected as the recovery method. By default, a SECONDARY
member will be chosen as donor. If no SECONDARY members are available the
PRIMARY will be selected. The option accepts values in the format: 'host:port'.
IPv6 addresses are not supported.

@attention The waitRecovery option will be removed in a future release.
Please use the recoveryProgress option instead.

@attention The interactive option will be removed in a future release.

This function removes an Instance from the replicaset and stops it from

During the switchover, the promoted instance will be synchronized with the

step takes too long or is not possible in any of the SECONDARY instances, the
switch will be aborted. These problematic SECONDARY instances must be either
repaired or removed from the replicaset for the fail over to be possible.

from the shell and have consistent transaction sets. If the PRIMARY is not
available, a failover must be performed instead, using <<<forcePrimaryInstance>>>().

Performs a failover in a replicaset with an unavailable PRIMARY.

@param instance host:port of the target instance to be promoted. If blank, a
suitable instance will be selected automatically.
@param options Dictionary with additional options.
@returns Nothing

This command will perform a failover of the PRIMARY of a replicaset
in disaster scenarios where the current PRIMARY is unavailable and cannot be
restored. If given, the target instance will be promoted to a PRIMARY, while
other reachable SECONDARY instances will be switched to the new PRIMARY. The
target instance must have the most up-to-date GTID_EXECUTED set among reachable
instances, otherwise the operation will fail. If a target instance is not given
(or is null), the most up-to-date instance will be automatically selected and
promoted.

After a failover, the old PRIMARY will be considered invalid by
the new PRIMARY and can no longer be part of the replicaset. If the instance
is still usable, it must be removed from the replicaset and re-added as a
new instance. If there were any SECONDARY instances that could not be
switched to the new PRIMARY during the failover, they will also be considered
invalid.

@attention a failover is a potentially destructive action and should
only be used as a last resort measure.

Data loss is possible after a failover, because the old PRIMARY may
have had transactions that were not yet replicated to the SECONDARY being
promoted. Moreover, if the instance that was presumed to have failed is still
able to process updates, for example because the network where it is located
is still functioning but unreachable from the shell, it will continue diverging
from the promoted clusters.
Recovering or re-conciliating diverged transaction sets requires
manual intervention and may some times not be possible, even if the failed
MySQL servers can be recovered. In many cases, the fastest and simplest
way to recover from a disaster that required a failover is by
discarding such diverged transactions and re-provisioning a new instance
from the newly promoted PRIMARY.

<b>Options</b>

The following options may be given:

@li dryRun: if true, will perform checks and log operations that would be
performed, but will not execute them. The operations that would be performed
can be viewed by enabling verbose output in the shell.
@li timeout: integer value with the maximum number of seconds to wait until
the instance being promoted catches up to the current PRIMARY.
@li invalidateErrorInstances: if false, aborts the failover if any instance
other than the old master is unreachable or has errors. If true, such instances
will not be failed over and be invalidated.

Dissolves the ReplicaSet.

@param options Dictionary with options for the operation.
@returns Nothing

This function stops and deletes asynchronous replication channels and
unregisters all members from the ReplicaSet metadata.

It keeps all the user's data intact.

<b>Options</b>

The options dictionary may contain the following attributes:

@li force: set to true to confirm that the dissolve operation must
be executed, even if some members of the ReplicaSet cannot be reached
or the timeout was reached when waiting for members to catch up with
replication changes. By default, set to false.
@li timeout: maximum number of seconds to wait for pending transactions
to be applied in each reachable instance of the ReplicaSet (default
value is retrieved from the 'dba.gtidWaitTimeout' shell option).

The force option (set to true) must only be used to dissolve a ReplicaSet
with instances that are permanently not available (no longer reachable)
or never to be reused again in a ReplicaSet. This allows a ReplicaSet to be
dissolved and remove it from the metadata, including instances than can no
longer be recovered. Otherwise, the instances must be brought back ONLINE
and the ReplicaSet dissolved without the force option to avoid errors
trying to reuse the instances and add them back to a ReplicaSet.

is to make to its statistics in the InnoDB Cluster metadata.

The stats_updates_frequency option accepts positive integers and sets the
frequency of updates of Router stats (timestamp, version, etc.), in seconds,
in the Metadata. If set to 0 (default), no periodic updates are done. Router
will round up the value to be a multiple of Router's TTL, i.e.:

@li If lower than TTL its gets rounded up to TTL, e.g. TTL=30, and
stats_updates_frequency=1, effective frequency is 30 seconds.

@li If not a multiple of TTL it will be rounded up and adjusted according to
the TTL, e.g. TTL=5, stats_updates_frequency=11, effective frequency is 15
seconds; TTL=5, stats_updates_frequency=13, effective frequency is 15 seconds.

If the value is null, the option value is cleared and the default value (0)
