//@<OUT> mysqlx help
NAME
      mysqlx - Encloses the functions and classes available to interact with an
               X Protocol enabled MySQL Product.

DESCRIPTION
      The objects contained on this module provide a full API to interact with
      the different MySQL Products implementing the X Protocol.

      In the case of a MySQL Server the API will enable doing operations on the
      different database objects such as schema management operations and both
      table and collection management and CRUD operations. (CRUD: Create, Read,
      Update, Delete).

      Intention of the module is to provide a full API for development through
      scripting languages such as JavaScript and Python, this would be normally
      achieved through a normal session.

      To use the properties and functions available on this module you first
      need to import it.

      When running the shell in interactive mode, this module is automatically
      imported.

CONSTANTS
 - LockContention Row locking mode constants.
 - Type           Data type constants.

FUNCTIONS
      dateValue(year, month, day[, hour, day, minute[, milliseconds]])

//@<OUT> Help on LockContention
NAME
      LockContention - Row locking mode constants.

SYNTAX
      mysqlx.LockContention

DESCRIPTION
      These constants are used to indicate the locking mode to be used at the
      lockShared and lockExclusive functions of the TableSelect and
      CollectionFind objects.

PROPERTIES
      DEFAULT
            A default locking mode.

      NOWAIT
            A locking read never waits to acquire a row lock. The query
            executes immediately, failing with an error if a requested row is
            locked.

      SKIP_LOCKED
            A locking read never waits to acquire a row lock. The query
            executes immediately, removing locked rows from the result set.

//@<OUT> Help on Schema
NAME
      Schema - Represents a Schema as retrieved from a session created using
               the X Protocol.

DESCRIPTION
      View Support

      MySQL Views are stored queries that when executed produce a result set.

      MySQL supports the concept of Updatable Views: in specific conditions are
      met, Views can be used not only to retrieve data from them but also to
      update, add and delete records.

      For the purpose of this API, Views behave similar to a Table, and so they
      are treated as Tables.

      Tables and Collections as Properties

      A Schema object may expose tables and collections as properties, this way
      they can be accessed as:

      - schema.<collection_name>
      - schema.<table_name>

      This handy way of accessing tables and collections is available if they
      met the following conditions:

      - They existed at the moment the Schema object was retrieved from the
        session.
      - The name is a valid identifier.
      - The name is different from any other property or function on the Schema
