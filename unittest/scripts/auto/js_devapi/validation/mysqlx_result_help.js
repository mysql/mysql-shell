//@<OUT> Help on getExecutionTime
NAME
      getExecutionTime - Retrieves a string value indicating the execution time
                         of the executed operation.

//@<OUT> Help on getGeneratedIds
NAME
      getGeneratedIds - Returns the list of document ids generated on the

SYNTAX
      <Result>.getGeneratedIds()

RETURNS
      a list of strings containing the generated ids.

DESCRIPTION
      When adding documents into a collection, it is required that an ID is
      associated to the document, if a document is added without an '_id'
      field, an error will be generated.

      At MySQL 8.0.11 if the documents being added do not have an '_id' field,
      the server will automatically generate an ID and assign it to the
      document.

      This function returns a list of the IDs that were generated for the
      server to satisfy this requirement.
