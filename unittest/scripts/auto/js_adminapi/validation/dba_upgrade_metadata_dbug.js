Metadata Schema Upgrade

The topology you are connected to is using an outdated metadata schema version 1.0.1 and needs to be upgraded to 2.3.0.

Without doing this upgrade, no AdminAPI calls except read only operations will be allowed.

NOTE: After the upgrade, this InnoDB Cluster/ReplicaSet can no longer be managed using older versions of MySQL Shell.

The grants for the MySQL Router accounts that were created automatically when bootstrapping need to be updated to match the new metadata version's requirements.
NOTE: No automatically created Router accounts were found.
WARNING: If MySQL Routers have been bootstrapped using custom accounts, their grants can not be updated during the metadata upgrade, they have to be updated using the setupRouterAccount function.
For additional information use: \? setupRouterAccount

An upgrade of all cluster router instances is required. All router installations should be updated first before doing the actual metadata upgrade.

There are 2 Routers to upgrade. Please upgrade them and select Continue once they are restarted.

NOTE: If Router's Metadata Cache TTL is high Router's own update in the Metadata will take longer. Re-check for outdated Routers if that's the case or alternatively restart the Router.

  1) Re-check for outdated Routers and continue with the metadata upgrade.
  2) Unregister the remaining Routers.
  3) Abort the operation.
