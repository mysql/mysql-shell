//@<OUT> util checkForServerUpgrade help
NAME
      checkForServerUpgrade - Performs series of tests on specified MySQL
                              server to check if the upgrade process will
                              succeed.

SYNTAX
      util.checkForServerUpgrade([connectionData][, options])

WHERE
      connectionData: The connection data to server to be checked
      options: Dictionary of options to modify tool behaviour.

DESCRIPTION
      If no connectionData is specified tool will try to establish connection
      using data from current session.

      Tool behaviour can be modified with following options:

      - configPath - full path to MySQL server configuration file.
      - outputFormat - value can be either TEXT (default) or JSON.
      - targetVersion - version to which upgrade will be checked
        (default=<<<__mysh_version>>>)
      - password - password for connection.

      The connection data may be specified in the following formats:

      - A URI string
      - A dictionary with the connection options

      A basic URI string has the following format:

      [scheme://][user[:password]@]<host[:port]|socket>[/schema][?option=value&option=value...]

      SSL Connection Options

      The following options are valid for use either in a URI or in a
      dictionary:

      - ssl-mode: the SSL mode to be used in the connection.
      - ssl-ca: the path to the X509 certificate authority in PEM format.
      - ssl-capath: the path to the directory that contains the X509
        certificates authorities in PEM format.
      - ssl-cert: The path to the X509 certificate in PEM format.
      - ssl-key: The path to the X509 key in PEM format.
      - ssl-crl: The path to file that contains certificate revocation lists.
      - ssl-crlpath: The path of directory that contains certificate revocation
        list files.
      - ssl-cipher: SSL Cipher to use.
      - tls-version: List of protocols permitted for secure connections
      - auth-method: Authentication method
      - get-server-public-key: Request public key from the server required for
        RSA key pair-based password exchange. Use when connecting to MySQL 8.0
        servers with classic MySQL sessions with SSL mode DISABLED.
      - server-public-key-path: The path name to a file containing a
        client-side copy of the public key required by the server for RSA key
        pair-based password exchange. Use when connecting to MySQL 8.0 servers
        with classic MySQL sessions with SSL mode DISABLED.
      - connect-timeout: The connection timeout in milliseconds. If not
        provided a default timeout of 10 seconds will be used. Specifying a
        value of 0 disables the connection timeout.
      - compression: Enable/disable compression in client/server protocol,
        valid values: "true", "false", "1", and "0".

      When these options are defined in a URI, their values must be URL
      encoded.

      The following options are also valid when a dictionary is used:

      Base Connection Options

      - scheme: the protocol to be used on the connection.
      - user: the MySQL user name to be used on the connection.
      - dbUser: alias for user.
      - password: the password to be used on the connection.
      - dbPassword: same as password.
      - host: the hostname or IP address to be used on a TCP connection.
      - port: the port to be used in a TCP connection.
      - socket: the socket file name to be used on a connection through unix
        sockets.
      - schema: the schema to be selected once the connection is done.

      ATTENTION: The dbUser and dbPassword options are will be removed in a
                 future release.

      The connection options are case insensitive and can only be defined once.

      If an option is defined more than once, an error will be generated.

      For additional information on connection data use \? connection.


//@<OUT> util importJson help
NAME
      importJson - Import JSON documents from file to collection or table in
                   MySQL Server using X Protocol session.

SYNTAX
      util.importJson(file[, options])

WHERE
      file: Path to JSON documents file
      options: Dictionary with import options

DESCRIPTION
      This function reads standard JSON documents from a file, however, it also
      supports converting BSON Data Types represented using the MongoDB
      Extended Json (strict mode) into MySQL values.

      The options dictionary supports the following options:

      - schema: string - name of target schema.
      - collection: string - name of collection where the data will be
        imported.
      - table: string - name of table where the data will be imported.
      - tableColumn: string (default: "doc") - name of column in target table
        where the imported JSON documents will be stored.
      - convertBsonTypes: bool (default: false) - enables the BSON data type
        conversion.
      - convertBsonOid: bool (default: the value of convertBsonTypes) - enables
        conversion of the BSON ObjectId values.
      - extractOidTime: string (default: empty) - creates a new field based on
        the ObjectID timestamp. Only valid if convertBsonOid is enabled.

      The following options are valid only when convertBsonTypes is enabled.
      They are all boolean flags. ignoreRegexOptions is enabled by default,
      rest are disabled by default.

      - ignoreDate: disables conversion of BSON Date values
      - ignoreTimestamp: disables conversion of BSON Timestamp values
      - ignoreRegex: disables conversion of BSON Regex values.
      - ignoreBinary: disables conversion of BSON BinData values.
      - decimalAsDouble: causes BSON Decimal values to be imported as double
        values.
      - ignoreRegexOptions: causes regex options to be ignored when processing
        a Regex BSON value. This option is only valid if ignoreRegex is
        disabled.

      If the schema is not provided, an active schema on the global session, if
      set, will be used.

      The collection and the table options cannot be combined. If they are not
      provided, the basename of the file without extension will be used as
      target collection name.

      If the target collection or table does not exist, they are created,
      otherwise the data is inserted into the existing collection or table.

      The tableColumn implies the use of the table option and cannot be
      combined with the collection option.

      BSON Data Type Processing.

      If only convertBsonOid is enabled, no conversion will be done on the rest
      of the BSON Data Types.

      To use extractOidTime, it should be set to a name which will be used to
      insert an additional field into the main document. The value of the new
      field will be the timestamp obtained from the ObjectID value. Note that
      this will be done only for an ObjectID value associated to the '_id'
      field of the main document.

      NumberLong and NumberInt values will be converted to integer values.

      NumberDecimal values are imported as strings, unless decimalAsDouble is
      enabled.

      Regex values will be converted to strings containing the regular
      expression. The regular expression options are ignored unless
      ignoreRegexOptions is disabled. When ignoreRegexOptions is disabled the
      regular expression will be converted to the form: /<regex>/<options>.

      Throws ArgumentError when:

      - Option name is invalid
      - Required options are not set and cannot be deduced
      - Shell is not connected to MySQL Server using X Protocol
      - Schema is not provided and there is no active schema on the global
        session
      - Both collection and table are specified

      Throws LogicError when:

      - Path to JSON document does not exists or is not a file

      Throws RuntimeError when:

      - The schema does not exists
      - MySQL Server returns an error

      Throws InvalidJson when:
