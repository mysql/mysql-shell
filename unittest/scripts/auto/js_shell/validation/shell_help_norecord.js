//@<OUT> Help on Reports
NAME
      reports - Gives access to built-in and user-defined reports.

SYNTAX
      shell.reports

DESCRIPTION
      The 'reports' object provides access to built-in reports.

      All user-defined reports registered using the shell.registerReport()
      method are also available here.

      The reports are provided as methods of this object, with names
      corresponding to the names of the available reports.

      All methods have the same signature: Dict report(Session session, List
      argv, Dict options), where:

      - session - Session object used by the report to obtain the data.
      - argv (optional) - Array of strings representing additional arguments.
      - options (optional) - Dictionary with values for various report-specific
        options.

      Each report returns a dictionary with the following keys:

      - report (required) - List of JSON objects containing the report. The
        number and types of items in this list depend on type of the report.

      For more information on a report use: shell.reports.help('report_name').

FUNCTIONS
      help([member])
            Provides help about this object and it's members

      query(session, argv)
            Executes the SQL statement given as arguments.

      threads(session[, argv][, options])
            Lists threads that belong to the user who owns the current session.

//@<OUT> Help on addExtensionObjectMember
NAME
      addExtensionObjectMember - Adds a member to an extension object.

SYNTAX
      shell.addExtensionObjectMember(object, name, member[, definition])

WHERE
      object: The object to which the member will be added.
      name: The name of the member being added.
      member: The member being added.
      definition: Dictionary with help information about the member.

DESCRIPTION
      The name parameter must be a valid identifier, this is, it should follow
      the pattern [_|a..z|A..Z]([_|a..z|A..Z|0..9])*

      The member parameter can be any of:

      - An extension object
      - A function
      - Scalar values: boolean, integer, float, string
      - Array
      - Dictionary
      - None/Null

      When an extension object is added as a member, a read only property will
      be added into the target extension object.

      When a function is added as member, it will be callable on the extension
      object but it will not be possible to overwrite it with a new value or
      function.

      When any of the other types are added as a member, a read/write property
      will be added into the target extension object, it will be possible to
      update the value without any restriction.

      IMPORTANT: every member added into an extensible object will be available
      only when the object is registered, this is, registered as a global shell
      object, or added as a member of another object that is already
      registered.

      The definition parameter is an optional and can be used to define
      additional information for the member.

      The member definition accepts the following attributes:

      - brief: optional string containing a brief description of the member
        being added.
      - details: optional array of strings containing detailed information
        about the member being added.

      This information will be integrated into the shell help to be available
      through the built in help system (\?).

      When adding a function, the following attribute is also allowed on the
      member definition:

      - parameters: a list of parameter definitions for each parameter that the
        function accepts.

      A parameter definition is a dictionary with the following attributes:

      - name: required, the name of the parameter, must be a valid identifier.
      - type: required, the data type of the parameter, allowed values include:
        string, integer, bool, float, array, dictionary, object.
      - required: a boolean value indicating whether the parameter is mandatory
        or optional.
      - brief: a string with a short description of the parameter.
      - details: a string array with additional details about the parameter.

      The information defined on the brief and details attributes will also be
      added to the function help on the built in help system (\?).

      If a parameter's type is 'string' the following attribute is also allowed
      on the parameter definition dictionary:

      - values: string array with the only values that are allowed for the
        parameter.

      If a parameter's type is 'object' the following attributes are also
      allowed on the parameter definition dictionary:

      - class: string defining the class of object allowed as parameter values.
      - classes: string array defining multiple classes of objects allowed as
        parameter values.

      The values for the class(es) properties must be a valid class exposed
      through the different APIs. For details use:

      - \? mysql
      - \? mysqlx
      - \? adminapi
      - \? shellapi

      To get the class name for a global object or a registered extension call
      the print function passing as parameter the object, i.e. "Shell" is the
      class name for the built in shell global object:

      mysql-js> print(shell)
      <Shell>
      mysql-js>

      If a parameter's type is 'dictionary' the following attribute is also
      allowed on the parameter definition dictionary:

      - options: list of option definition dictionaries defining the allowed
        options that can be passed on the dictionary parameter.

      An option definition dictionary follows exactly the same rules as the
      parameter definition dictionary except for one: on a parameter definition
      dictionary, required parameters must be defined first, option definition
      dictionaries do not have this restriction.

      connectToPrimary - Establishes the shell global session, connecting to a
                         primary of an InnoDB cluster or ReplicaSet.

SYNTAX
      shell.connectToPrimary([connectionData][, password])

WHERE
      connectionData: The connection data to be used to establish the session.
      password: The password to be used when establishing the session.

RETURNS
      The established session.

DESCRIPTION
      Ensures that the target server is a member of an InnoDB cluster or
      ReplicaSet and if it is not a PRIMARY, finds the PRIMARY and connects to
      it. Sets the global session object to the established session and returns
      that object.

      If connectionData is not given, this function uses the global shell
      session, if there is none, an exception is raised.

      The password may be included on the connectionData, the optional
      parameter should be used only if the connectionData does not contain it
      already. If both are specified the password parameter will override the
      password defined on the connectionData.

      The connection data may be specified in the following formats:

      - A URI string
      - A dictionary with the connection options

      A basic URI string has the following format:

      [scheme://][user[:password]@]<host[:port]|socket>[/schema][?option=value&option=value...]

      Connection Options

      The following options are valid for use either in a URI or in a

NAME
      createExtensionObject - Creates an extension object, it can be used to
                              extend shell functionality.

SYNTAX
      shell.createExtensionObject()

DESCRIPTION
      An extension object is defined by adding members in it (properties and
      functions).

      An extension object can be either added as a property of another
      extension object or registered as a shell global object.

      An extension object is usable only when it has been registered as a
      global object or when it has been added into another extension object
      that is member in an other registered object.

//@<OUT> Help on createResult
NAME
      createResult - Creates a ShellResult object from the given data.

SYNTAX
      shell.createResult([data])

WHERE
      data: Either a dictionary or a list of dictionaries with the data to be
            used in the result.

RETURNS
      ShellResult object representing the given data.

DESCRIPTION
      A result can be created using a dictionary with the following elements
      (all of them optional):

      - "affectedItemsCount" - The number of record affected by the SQL
        statement that produced the result.
      - "info" - Additional information about the result.
      - "executionTime" - The execution time of the SQL statement that produced
        this result.
      - "autoIncrementValue" - the last integer auto generated id (for insert
        operations).
      - "warnings" - a list of warnings associated to the Result.
      - "data" - a list of dictionaries representing a record in the Result.

      Creating a Result using an empty Dictionary is the same as creating an OK
      result with no data.

      A warning is defined as a dictionary with the following elements:

      - "level" - holds the warning type: error, warning, note.
      - "code" - integer number identifying the warning code.
      - "message" - describes the actual warning.

      When defining warnings, both level and message are mandatory.

      It is possible to create a multi-result Result object, to do so, instead
      of using a single data dictionary, provide a list of data dictionaries
      following the specification mentioned above.

//@<OUT> Help on Prompt
NAME
      prompt - Utility function to prompt data from the user.

SYNTAX
      shell.prompt(message[, options])

WHERE
      message: a string with the message to be shown to the user.
      options: Dictionary with options that change the function behavior.

RETURNS
      A string value containing the result based on the user input.

DESCRIPTION
      This function allows creating scripts that require interaction with the
      user to gather data.

      The options dictionary may contain the following options:

      - title: a string to identify the prompt.
      - description: a string list with a description of the prompt, each entry
        represents a paragraph.
      - type: a string value to define the prompt type. Supported types
        include: text, password, confirm, select, fileOpen, fileSave,
        directory. Default value: text.
      - defaultValue: defines the default value to be used in case the user
        accepts the prompt without providing custom information. The value of
        this option depends on the prompt type.
      - yes: string value to overwrite the default '&Yes' option on 'confirm'
        prompts.
      - no: string value to overwrite the default '&No' option on 'confirm'
        prompts.
      - alt: string value to define an additional option for 'confirm' prompts.
      - options: string list of options to be used in 'select' prompts.

      General Behavior

      The 'title' option is not used in the Shell but it might be useful for
      better integration with external plugins handling prompts.

      When the 'description' option is provided, each entry will be printed as
      a separate paragraph.

      Once the description is printed, the content of the message parameter
      will be printed and input from the user will be required.

      The value of the 'defaultValue' option and the returned value will depend
      on the 'type' option, as explained on the following sections.

      Open Prompts

      These represent prompts without a pre-defined set of valid answers, the
      prompt types on this category include: text, password, fileOpen, fileSave
      and directory.

      The 'defaultValue' on these prompts can be set to a string to be returned
      by the function if the user replies to the prompt with an empty string,
      if not defined then the prompt will accept and return the empty string.

      The returned value on these prompts will be either the value set on
      'defaultValue' option or the value entered by the user.

      In the case of password type prompts, the data entered by the user will
      not be displayed on the screen.

      Confirm Prompts

      The default behaviour of these prompts if to allow the user answering
      Yes/No questions, however, the default '&Yes' and '&No' options can be
      overriden through the 'yes' and 'no' options.

      An additional option can be added to the prompt by defining the 'alt'
      option.

      The 'yes', 'no' and 'alt' options are used to define the valid answers
      for the prompt. The ampersand (&) symbol can be used to define a single
      character which acts as a shortcut for the user to select the indicated
      answer.

      i.e. using an option like: '&Yes' causes the following to be valid
      answers (case insensitive): 'Yes', '&Yes', 'Y'.

      All the valid answers must be unique within the prompt call.

      If the 'defaultValue' option is defined, it must be set equal to any of
      the valid prompt answers, i.e. if the 'yes', 'no' and 'alt' options are
      not defined, then 'defaultValue' can be set to one of '&Yes', 'Yes', 'Y',
      '&No', 'No' or 'N', case insensitive, otherwise, it must be set to one of
      the valid answers based on the values defined in the 'yes', 'no' or 'alt'
      options.

      This prompt will be shown repeatedly until the user explicitly replies
      with one of the valid answers unless a 'defaultValue' is provided, which
      will be used in case the user replies with an empty answer.

      The returned value will be the label associated to the user provided
      answer.

      i.e. if the prompt is using the default options ('&Yes' and '&No') and
      the user response is 'n' the prompt function will return '&No'.

      Select Prompts

      These prompts allow the user selecting an option from a pre-defined list
      of options.

      To define the list of options to be used in the prompt the 'options'
      option should be used.

      If the 'defaultValue' option is defined, it must be a number representing
      the 1 based index of the option to be selected by default.

      This prompt will be shown repeatedly until the user explicitly replies
      with the 1 based index of the option to be selected unless a default
      option is pre-defined through the 'defaultValue' option.

      The returned value will be the text of the selected option.

      is, no naming convention is enforced on global objects.

      The definition parameter is a dictionary with help information about the
      object being registered, it allows the following properties:

      - brief: a string with a brief description of the object.
      - details: a list of strings with additional information about the
        object.

      type: Type of the registered report, one of: 'list', 'report' or 'print'.
      report: Function to be called when the report is requested.
      description: Dictionary describing the report being registered.

DESCRIPTION
      The name of the report must be unique and a valid scripting identifier. A
      case-insensitive comparison is used to validate the uniqueness.

      The type of the report must be one of: 'list', 'report' or 'print'. This
      option specifies the expected result of calling this report as well as
      the output format if it is invoked using \show or \watch commands.

      The report function must have the following signature: Dict
      report(Session session, List argv, Dict options), where:

      - session - Session object used by the report to obtain the data.
      - argv (optional) - Array of strings representing additional arguments.
      - options (optional) - Dictionary with values for various report-specific
        options.

      Each report returns a dictionary with the following keys:

      - report (required) - List of JSON objects containing the report. The
        number and types of items in this list depend on type of the report.

      The description dictionary may contain the following optional keys:

      - brief - A string value providing a brief description of the report.
      - details - A list of strings providing a detailed description of the
        report.
      - options - A list of dictionaries describing the options accepted by the
        report. If this is not provided, the report does not accept any
        options.

        accepted by the report. This string can be either: a number specifying
        exact number of arguments, * specifying zero or more arguments, two
        numbers separated by a '-' specifying a range of arguments or a number
        and * separated by a '-' specifying a range of arguments without an
        upper bound. If this is not provided, the report does not accept any
        additional arguments.
      - examples - A list of dictionaries describing the example usage of the
        report.

      The optional options list must hold dictionaries with the following keys:

      - name (string, required) - Name of the option, must be a valid scripting
        identifier. This specifies an option name in the long form (--long)
        when invoking the report using \show or \watch commands or a key name
        of an option when calling this report as a function. Must be unique for
        a report.
      - shortcut (string, optional) - alternate name of the option, must be an
        alphanumeric character. This specifies an option name in the short form
        (-s). The short form of an option can only be used when invoking the
        report using \show or \watch commands, it is not available when calling
        the report as a function. If this key is not specified, option will not
        have a short form. Must be unique for a report.
      - brief (string, optional) - brief description of the option.
      - details (array of strings, optional) - detailed description of the
        option.
      - type (string, optional) - value type of the option. Allowed values are:
        'string', 'bool', 'integer', 'float'. If this key is not specified it
        defaults to 'string'. If type is specified as 'bool', this option is a
        switch: if it is not specified when invoking the report it defaults to
        'false'; if it's specified when invoking the report using \show or
        \watch commands it does not accept any value and defaults to 'true'; if
        it is specified when invoking the report using the function call it
        must have a valid value.
      - required (Boolean, optional) - whether this option is required. If this
        key is not specified, defaults to false. If option is a 'bool' then
        'required' cannot be 'true'.
      - values (list of strings, optional) - list of allowed values. Only
        'string' options may have this key. If this key is not specified, this
        option accepts any values.
      - empty (Boolean, optional) - whether this option accepts empty strings.
        Only 'string' options may have this key. If this key is not specified,
        defaults to false.

      The optional examples list must hold dictionaries with the following
      keys:

      - description (string, required) - Description text of the example.
      - args (list of strings, optional) - List of the arguments used in the
        example.
      - options (dictionary of strings, optional) - Options used in the
        example.

      The type of the report determines the expected result of a report
      invocation:

      - The 'list' report returns a list of lists of values, with the first
        item containing the names of the columns and remaining ones containing
        the rows with values.
      - The 'report' report returns a list with a single item.
      - The 'print' report returns an empty list.

      The type of the report also determines the output form when report is
      called using \show or \watch commands:

      - The 'list' report will be displayed in tabular form (or vertical if
        --vertical option is used).
      - The 'report' report will be displayed in YAML format.
      - The 'print' report will not be formatted by Shell, the report itself
        will print out any output.

      The registered report is can be called using \show or \watch commands in
      any of the scripting modes.

      The registered report is also going to be available as a method of the
      shell.reports object.

      Users may create custom report files in the init.d folder located in the
      Shell configuration path (by default it is ~/.mysqlsh/init.d in Unix and
      %AppData%\MySQL\mysqlsh\init.d in Windows).

      Custom reports may be written in either JavaScript or Python. The
      standard file extension for each case should be used to get them properly
      loaded.

      All reports registered in those files using the registerReport() method
      will be available when Shell starts.

EXCEPTIONS
      Throws ArgumentError in the following scenarios:

      - if a report with the same name is already registered.
      - if 'name' of a report is not a valid scripting identifier.
      - if 'type' is not one of: 'list', 'report' or 'print'.
      - if 'name' of a report option is not a valid scripting identifier.
      - if 'name' of a report option is reused in multiple options.
      - if 'shortcut' of a report option is not an alphanumeric character.
      - if 'shortcut' of a report option is reused in multiple options.
      - if 'type' of a report option holds an invalid value.
      - if the 'argc' key of a 'description' dictionary holds an invalid value.

//@<OUT> Help on registerSQLHandler
NAME
      registerSqlHandler - Registers a custom SQL Handler to intercept and
                           handle matching SQL statements.

SYNTAX
      shell.registerSqlHandler(name, description, prefixes, callback)

WHERE
      name: A name that uniquely identifies the SQL handler.
      description: A brief description of the SQL extensions provided by the
                   SQL handler.
      prefixes: List of prefixes to identify the SQL statements to be processed
                by this handler.
      callback: The function to be executed when a statement implemented on
                this SQL handler is identified.

DESCRIPTION
      SQL statements are intercepted in user created sessions and when
      applicable, they are processed using the corresponding SQL Handler.

      User created sessions include the MySQL Shell Global Session and the
      sessions created with the different API functions available.

      The function provided on the callback parameter is expected to have the
      following signature:

          function(session, sql): [Result]

      The Session used to execute the SQL statement will first identify if a
      specific SQL handler should be used to process it. If that is the case,
      the associated callback will be executed.

      If the function returns a Result object the SQL processing will be
      considered complete; if no data is returned, the Session will proceed to
      execute the SQL statement.

      The selection of a custom SQL handler for execution will be done by
      matching the SQL with the prefixes defined on the handler by ignoring
      leading white spaces and coalescing multiple white spaces between non
      space characters.

      The callback function may return a Result object, which can be created by
      calling shell.createResult.

When these options are defined in a URI, their values must be URL encoded.

The following options are also valid when a dictionary is used:

Base Connection Options

- uri: a URI string.
- scheme: the protocol to be used on the connection.
- user: the MySQL user name to be used on the connection.
- password: the password to be used on the connection.
- host: the hostname or IP address to be used on the connection.

- ssh-identity-file-password: the SSH key file password.
- ssh-config-file: the SSH configuration file, default is the value of
  shell.options['ssh.configFile']

ATTENTION: The connection options have precedence over options specified in the
           connection options uri

The connection options are case insensitive and can only be defined once.

If an option is defined more than once, an error will be generated.

The options specified in the connection data determine the type of connection
to be used.

The scheme option defines the protocol to be used on the connection, the
following are the accepted values:

- mysql: for connections using the MySQL protocol.
- mysqlx: for connections using the X protocol.

If no protocol is specified in the connection data, the shell will first
attempt connecting using the X protocol, if the connection fails it will then
try to connect using the MySQL protocol.

In general, the Shell connects to the server using TCP connections, unless the
connection data contains the options required to create any of the connections
described below.

Unix-domain Socket Connections

To connect to a local MySQL server using a Unix-domain socket, the host must be
set to 'localhost', no port number should be provided and the socket path
should be provided.

When using the MySQL protocol, the socket path might not be provided, in such
case a default path for the socket file will be used.

When using a connection dictionary, the socket path is set as the value for the
socket option.

When using a URI, the socket path must be URL encoded as follows:

- user@/path%2Fto%2Fsocket.sock
- user@./path%2Fto%2Fsocket.sock
- user@../path%2Fto%2Fsocket.sock

It is possible to skip the URL encoding by enclosing the socket path in
parenthesis:

- user@(/path/to/socket.sock)
- user@(./path/to/socket.sock)
- user@(../path/to/socket.sock)

Windows Named Pipe Connections

To connect to MySQL server using a named pipe the host must be set to '.', no
port number should be provided.

If the pipe name is not provided the default pipe name will be used: MySQL.

When using a connection dictionary, the named pipe name is set as the value for
the socket option.

When using a URI, if the named pipe has invalid characters for a URL, they must
be URL encoded. URL encoding can be skipped by enclosing the pipe name in
parenthesis:

- user@\\.\named.pipe
- user@(\\.\named.pipe)

Named pipe connections are only supported on the MySQL protocol.

Windows Shared Memory Connections

Shared memory connections are only allowed if the server has shared memory
connections enabled using the default shared memory base name: MySQL.

To connect to a local MySQL server using shared memory the host should be set
to 'localhost' and no port should be provided.

If the server does not have shared memory connections enabled using the default
base name, the connection will be done using TCP.

Shared memory connections are only supported on the MySQL protocol.

SSL Mode

The ssl-mode option accepts the following values:

- DISABLED
- PREFERRED
- REQUIRED
- VERIFY_CA
- VERIFY_IDENTITY

TLS Version

The tls-version option accepts values in the following format: TLSv<version>,
e.g. TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3.

Authentication method

In case of classic session, this is the name of the authentication plugin to
use, i.e. caching_sha2_password.

In case of X protocol session, it should be one of:

- AUTO,
- FROM_CAPABILITIES,
- FALLBACK,
- MYSQL41,
- PLAIN,
- SHA256_MEMORY.

Connection Compression

Connection compression is governed by following connection options:
"compression", "compression-algorithms", and "compression-level".

"compression" accepts following values:

- REQUIRED: connection will only be made when compression negotiation is
  succesful.
- PREFFERED: (default for X protocol connections) shell will attempt to
  establish connection with compression enabled, but if compression negotiation
  fails, connection will be established without compression.
- DISABLED: (defalut for classic protocol connections) connection will be
  established without compression.

For convenience "compression" also accepts Boolean: 'True', 'False', '1', and
'0' values which map to REQUIRED and DISABLED respectively.

"compression-algorithms" expects comma separated list of algorithms. Supported
algorithms include:

- zstd
- zlib
- lz4 (X protocol only)
- uncompressed - special value, which if it appears in the list, causes
  connection to succeed even if compression negotiation fails.

If "compression" connection option is not defined, its value will be deduced
from "compression-algorithms" value when it is provided.

"compression-level" expects an integer value. Valid range depends on the
compression algorithm and server configuration, but generally following is
expected:

- zstd: 1-22 (default 3)
- zlib: 1-9 (default 3), supported only by X protocol
- lz4: 0-16 (default 2), supported only by X protocol.

Connection Attributes

Connection attributes are key-value pairs to be sent to the server at connect
time. They are stored at the following PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA tables:

- session_account_connect_attrs: attributes for the current session, and other
  sessions associated with the session account.
- session_connect_attrs: attributes for all sessions.

These attributes should be defined when creating a session and are immutable
during the life-time of the session.

To define connection attributes on a URI, the connection-attributes should be
defined as part of the URI as follows:

root@localhost:port/schema?connection-attributes=[att1=value1,att2=val2,...]

Note that the characters used for the attribute name and value must follow the
URI standard, this is, if the character is not allowed it must be percent
encoded.

To define connection attributes when creating a session using a dictionary the
connection-attributes option should be defined, its value can be set in the
following formats:

- Array of "key=value" pairs.
- Dictionary containing the key-value pairs.

Note that the connection-attribute values are expected to be strings, if other
data type is used in the dictionary, the string representation of the used data
will be stored on the database.

URL Encoding

URL encoded values only accept alphanumeric characters and the next symbols:
-._~!$'()*+;

Any other character must be URL encoded.

URL encoding is done by replacing the character being encoded by the sequence:
%XX

Where XX is the hexadecimal ASCII value of the character being encoded.

If host is a literal IPv6 address it should be enclosed in "[" and "]"
characters.

If host is a literal IPv6 address with zone ID, the '%' character separating
address from the zone ID needs to be URL encoded.

//@<OUT> Help on extension objects
The MySQL Shell allows for an extension of its base functionality by using
special objects called Extension Objects.

Once an extension object has been created it is possible to attach different
type of object members such as:

- Functions
- Properties
- Other extension objects

Once an extension object has been fully defined it can be registered as a
regular Global Object. This way the object and its members will be available in
the scripting languages the MySQL Shell supports, just as any other global
object such as shell, util, etc.

Extending the MySQL Shell with extension objects follows this pattern:

- Creation of a new extension object.
- Addition of members (properties, functions)
- Registration of the object

Creation of a new extension object is done through the
shell.createExtensionObject function.

Members can be attached to the extension object by calling the
shell.addExtensionObjectMember function.

Registration of an extension object as a global object can be done by calling
the shell.registerGlobal function.

Alternatively, the extension object can be added as a member of another
extension object by calling the shell.addExtensionObjectMember function.

You can get more details on these functions by executing:

- \? createExtensionObject
- \? addExtensionObjectMember
- \? registerGlobal

Naming Convention

The core MySQL Shell APIs follow a specific naming convention for object
members. Extension objects should follow the same naming convention for
consistency reasons.

- JavaScript members use camelCaseNaming
- Python members use snake_case_naming

To simplify this across languages, it is important to use camelCaseNaming when
specifying the 'name' parameter of the shell.addExtensionObjectMember function.

The MySQL Shell will then automatically handle the snake_case_naming for that
member when it is switched to Python mode.

NOTE: the naming convention is only applicable for extension object members.
However, when a global object is registered, the name used to register that
object will be exactly the same in both JavaScript and Python modes.

Example:

# Sample python function to be added to an extension object
def some_python_function():
  print ("Hello world!")

# The extension object is created
obj = shell.create_extension_object()

# The sample function is added as member
# NOTE: The member name using camelCaseNaming
shell.add_extension_object_member(obj, "mySampleFunction",
some_python_function)

# The extension object is registered
shell.register_global("myCustomObject", obj)

Calling in JavaScript:

// Member is available using camelCaseNaming
mysql-js> myCustomObject.mySampleFunction()
Hello World!
mysql-js>

Calling in Python:

# Member is available using snake_case_naming
mysql-py> myCustomObject.my_sample_function()
Hello World!
mysql-py>

Automatic Loading of Extension Objects

The MySQL Shell startup logic scans for extension scripts at the following
paths:
