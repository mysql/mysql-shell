#@<OUT> Help on Admin API Category
The AdminAPI can be used interactively from the MySQL Shell prompt and
non-interactively from JavaScript and Python scripts and directly from the
command line.

For more information about the dba object use: \? dba

In the AdminAPI, an InnoDB Cluster is represented as an instance of the Cluster
class, while ReplicaSets are represented as an instance of the ReplicaSet
class, and ClusterSets are represented as an instance of the ClusterSet class.

For more information about the Cluster class use: \? Cluster

For more information about the ClusterSet class use: \? ClusterSet

For more information about the ReplicaSet class use: \? ReplicaSet

Scripting

Through the JavaScript and Python bindings of the MySQL Shell, the AdminAPI can
be used from scripts, which can in turn be used interactively or
non-interactively. To execute a script, use the -f command line option,
followed by the script file path. Options that follow the path are passed
directly to the script being executed, which can access them from sys.argv
    mysqlsh root@localhost -f myscript.py arg1 arg2

If the script finishes successfully, the Shell will exit with code 0, while
uncaught exceptions/errors cause it to exist with a non-0 code.

By default, the AdminAPI enables interactivity, which will cause functions to
prompt for missing passwords, confirmations and bits of information that cannot
be obtained automatically.

Prompts can be completely disabled with the --no-wizard command line option or
using the "interactive" boolean option available in some of functions. If
interactivity is disabled and some information is missing (e.g. a password), an
error will be raised instead of being prompted.

Secure Password Handling

Passwords can be safely stored locally, using the system's native secrets
storage functionality (or login-paths in Linux). Whenever the Shell needs a
password, it will first query for the password in the system, before prompting
for it.

Passwords can be stored during interactive use, by confirming in the Store
Password prompt. They can also be stored programmatically, using the
shell.store_credential() function.

You can also use environment variables to pass information to your scripts. In
JavaScript, the os.getenv() function can be used to access them.

Command Line Interface

In addition to the scripting interface, the MySQL Shell supports generic
command line integration, which allows calling AdminAPI functions directly from
the system shell (e.g. bash). Examples:
    $ mysqlsh -- dba configure-instance root@localhost

    is equivalent to:

    > dba.configureInstance("root@localhost")

    $ mysqlsh root@localhost -- cluster status --extended

    is equivalent to:

    > dba.getCluster().status({extended:true})

The mapping from AdminAPI function signatures works as follows:

- The first argument after a -- can be a shell global object, such as dba. As a
  special case, cluster and rs are also accepted.
- The second argument is the name of the function of the object to be called.
  The naming convention is automatically converted from camelCase/snake_case to
  lower case separated by dashes.
- The rest of the arguments are used in the same order as their JS/Python
  counterparts. Instances can be given as URIs. Option dictionaries can be
  passed as --options, where the option name is the same as in JS/Python.

OBJECTS
 - dba InnoDB Cluster, ReplicaSet, and ClusterSet management functions.

CLASSES
 - Cluster          Represents an InnoDB Cluster.
 - ClusterSet       Represents an InnoDB ClusterSet.
 - ReplicaSet       Represents an InnoDB ReplicaSet.

#@<OUT> Help for API Command Line Integration
The MySQL Shell functionality is generally available as API calls, this is
objects containing methods to perform specific tasks, they can be called either
in JavaScript or Python modes.

The most important functionality (available on the shell global objects) has
been integrated in a way that it is possible to call it directly from the
command line, by following a specific syntax.

SYNTAX:

  mysqlsh [options] -- <object> <operation> [arguments]

WHERE:

- object - a string identifying shell object to be called.
- operation - a string identifying method to be called on the object.
- arguments - arguments passed to the called method.

DETAILS:

The following objects can be called using this format:

- dba - dba global object.
- cluster - cluster returned by calling dba.getCluster().
- shell - shell global object.
- shell.options - shell.options object.
- util - util global object

The operation name can be given in the following naming styles:

- Camel case: (e.g. createCluster, checkForServerUpgrade)
- Kebab case: (e.g. create-cluster, check-for-server-upgrade)

The arguments syntax allows mixing positional and named arguments (similar to
args and *kwargs in Python):

ARGUMENT SYNTAX:

  [ positional_argument ]* [ { named_argument* } ]* [ named_argument ]*

WHERE:

- positional_argument - is a single string representing a value.
- named_argument - a string in the form of --argument-name[=value]

A positional_argument is defined by the following rules:

- positional_argument ::= value
- value   ::= string | integer | float | boolean | null
- string  ::= plain string, quoted if contains whitespace characters
- integer ::= plain integer
- float   ::= plain float
- boolean ::= 1 | 0 | true | false
- null    ::= "-"

Positional arguments are passed to the function call in the order they are
defined.

Named arguments represent a dictionary option that the method is expecting. It
is created by prepending the option name with double dash and can also be
specified either using camelCaseNaming or kebab-case-naming, examples:

--anOptionName[=value]
--an-option-name[=value]

If the value is not provided the option name will be handled as a boolean
option with a default value of TRUE.

Following are some examples of command line calls as well as how they are
mapped to the API method call.

EXAMPLES
$ mysqlsh -- dba deploy-sandbox-instance 1234 --password=secret
      mysql-js> dba.deploySandboxInstance(1234, {password: secret})

$ mysqlsh root@localhost:1234 -- dba create-cluster mycluster
      mysql-js> dba.createCluster("mycluster")

$ mysqlsh root@localhost:1234 -- cluster status
      mysql-js> cluster.status()

$ mysqlsh -- shell.options set-persist history.autoSave true
      mysql-js> shell.options.setPersist("history.autoSave", true)

$ mysqlsh -- util checkForServerUpgrade root@localhost --outputFormat=JSON
      mysql-js> util.checkForServerUpgrade("root@localhost",{outputFormat:
      "JSON"})

$ mysqlsh -- util check-for-server-upgrade --user=root --host=localhost
--password=
      mysql-js> util.checkForServerUpgrade({user:"root", host:"localhost"},
      {password:""})
