      - compression-algorithms: Use compression algorithm in server/client
        protocol.

      The connection options are case insensitive and can only be defined once.

      If an option is defined more than once, an error will be generated.

      For additional information on connection data use \? connection.

#@<OUT> mysqlx help
NAME
      mysqlx - Encloses the functions and classes available to interact with an
               X Protocol enabled MySQL Product.

DESCRIPTION
      The objects contained on this module provide a full API to interact with
      the different MySQL Products implementing the X Protocol.

      In the case of a MySQL Server the API will enable doing operations on the
      different database objects such as schema management operations and both
      table and collection management and CRUD operations. (CRUD: Create, Read,
      Update, Delete).

      Intention of the module is to provide a full API for development through
      scripting languages such as JavaScript and Python, this would be normally
      achieved through a normal session.

      To use the properties and functions available on this module you first
      need to import it.

      When running the shell in interactive mode, this module is automatically
      imported.

#@<OUT> Help on LockContention
NAME
      LockContention - Row locking mode constants.

SYNTAX

            A default locking mode.

      NOWAIT
            A locking read never waits to acquire a row lock. The query

#@<OUT> Help on Schema
NAME
      Schema - Represents a Schema as retrieved from a session created using
               the X Protocol.

DESCRIPTION
      View Support

      MySQL Views are stored queries that when executed produce a result set.

      MySQL supports the concept of Updatable Views: in specific conditions are
      met, Views can be used not only to retrieve data from them but also to
      update, add and delete records.

      For the purpose of this API, Views behave similar to a Table, and so they
      are treated as Tables.

      Tables and Collections as Properties

      A Schema object may expose tables and collections as properties, this way
      they can be accessed as:

      - schema.<collection_name>
      - schema.<table_name>

      This handy way of accessing tables and collections is available if they
      met the following conditions:

      - They existed at the moment the Schema object was retrieved from the
        session.
      - The name is a valid identifier.
      - The name is different from any other property or function on the Schema
        object.

      If any of the conditions is not met, the way to access the table or
      collection is by using the standard DevAPI functions:

      - schema.get_table(<name>)
      - schema.get_collection(<name>)

PROPERTIES
      name
            The name of this database object.

      schema
            The Schema object of this database object.

      session
            The Session object of this database object.

      Some tables and collections are also exposed as properties of the Schema
      object. For details look at 'Tables and Collections as Properties' on the
      DETAILS section.

FUNCTIONS
      create_collection(name[, options])
            Creates in the current schema a new collection with the specified
            name and retrieves an object representing the new collection
            created.

      drop_collection()
            Drops the specified collection.

      exists_in_database()
            Verifies if this object exists in the database.

      get_collection(name)
            Returns the Collection of the given name for this schema.

      get_collection_as_table(name)
            Returns a Table object representing a Collection on the database.

      get_collections()
            Returns a list of Collections for this Schema.

      get_name()
            Returns the name of this database object.

      get_schema()
            Returns the Schema object of this database object.

            Returns the Table of the given name for this schema.
