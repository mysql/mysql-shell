DESCRIPTION
      Warnings are generated sometimes when database operations are executed,
      such as SQL statements.

      On a Node session the warning generation is disabled by default. This
      function can be used to enable or disable the warning generation based on
      the received parameter.

      When warning generation is enabled, the warnings will be available
      through the result object returned on the executed operation.

#@<OUT> session.set_savepoint

WHERE
      name: String with the name to be assigned to the transaction save point.

RETURNS
      The name of the transaction savepoint.

DESCRIPTION
      When working with transactions, using savepoints allows rolling back
      operations executed after the savepoint without terminating the
      transaction.

      Use this function to set a savepoint within a transaction.

      If this function is called with the same name of another savepoint set
      previously, the original savepoint will be deleted and a new one will be
      created.

      If the name is not provided an auto-generated name as 'TXSP#' will be
      assigned, where # is a consecutive number that guarantees uniqueness of
      the savepoint at Session level.

#@<OUT> session.sql
NAME
      sql - Creates a SqlExecute object to allow running the received SQL
            statement on the target MySQL Server.

SYNTAX
      Session.sql(statement)
             [.bind(data)]
             [.execute()]

DESCRIPTION
      This method creates an SqlExecute object which is a SQL execution
      handler.

      The SqlExecute class has functions that allow defining the way the
      statement will be executed and allows doing parameter binding.

      The received SQL is set on the execution handler.

      sql(statement)
            This function is called automatically when Session.sql(sql) is
            called.

            Parameter binding is supported and can be done by using the \b ?
            placeholder instead of passing values directly on the SQL
            statement.

            Parameters are bound in positional order.

            The actual execution of the SQL statement will occur when the
            execute() function is called.

            After this function invocation, the following functions can be
            invoked:

            - bind(Value data)
            - execute().

      bind(data)
            This method can be invoked any number of times, each time the
            received parameters will be added to an internal binding list.

            This function can be invoked after:

            - sql(String statement)
            - bind(Value data)

            After this function invocation, the following functions can be
            invoked:

            - bind(Value data)
            - execute().

      execute()
            This function can be invoked after:

            - sql(String statement)
            - bind(Value data)

#@<OUT> session.start_transaction
NAME
      start_transaction - Starts a transaction context on the server.

SYNTAX
      <Session>.start_transaction()

RETURNS
      A SqlResult object.

DESCRIPTION
      Calling this function will turn off the autocommit mode on the server.

      All the operations executed after calling this function will take place
      only when commit() is called.

      All the operations executed after calling this function, will be
      discarded if rollback() is called.

      When commit() or rollback() are called, the server autocommit mode will
      return back to it's state before calling start_transaction().

#@<OUT> session.uri
NAME
      uri - Retrieves the URI for the current session.

SYNTAX
      <Session>.uri
