/**
 * Fault injection interface class.
 *
 * This allows test code to cause instrumented code to throw exceptions or
 * abort instead of following normal execution, making testing of error cases
 * simpler. It's similar to dbug, but is more flexible because the exceptions
 * being thrown and the exact cases where they're thrown can be customized
 * at runtime.
 *
 * There are 2 sides for that:
 *
 * - the tested code, that registers an injector and triggers them
 * - and the test code, that sets up traps that cause specific triggers to be
 * fired at specific points in execution
 *
 * An injector is a custom routine that executes a custom action, like throwing
 * an exception or calling abort(). That can be done with the FI_DEFINE()
 * macro, which is only enabled if NDEBUG is NOT defined.
 *
 * These injectors must then be invoked by the code to be tested (e.g. right
 * before SQL is executed, to simulate client or server DB errors) by using
 * FI_TRIGGER_TRAP(). This will go through traps defined by test code and
 * check if conditions set by the trap are true and if so, invoke the injector.
 *
 * Traps specify that a trigger must be executed when a given list of conditions
 * is met. The list of conditions can include simple logical expressions that
 * are evaluated against variables set by the tested code or the number of times
 * that a trap was tripped. That makes it possible for an error to be injected
 * only when a specific SQL statement is executed 3 times, for example.
 *
 * The trap can also define details about the exception being thrown, like error
 * codes, exception text and so on. These variables/options are injector
 * specific and just forwarded as trap options to the injector function.
